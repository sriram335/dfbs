<p class="messageBox"  align="left">
<b><u>FAQ's</u></b></br>
Q1. Can I upload Zip file(s)?</br>
A1. No, currently we allow only pdf diles, to save review time by reviewer. However you can submit all pdf files in a book form as a single file.</br>
Q2. Do I have to upload all the files individually?</br>
A2. No, if you have all the plans in a pdf book form (even if they are a mix of Architectural, Sprinkler, Foundation etc.,) 
in a single pdf, upload the file under Architectural plan type.</br>
Q3. My file type is not listed in the drop down, what do I do ?</br>
A3. Use Other Documents option.</br>
